# Session
This committee will be in charge of speaker selection and communication. This includes talk selection, and all speaker communications.

## Role Description
The session commitee is the group of individuals that brings the agenda together for the event. Without the session committee, the event would have a challenging time bringing people together to discuss and engage in our Cloud Native focused event. Many of the talks that we help curate help shape the conversations for KCD Costa Rica, and takes commitment throughout the year to understand what would bring the best conversations to the event.
