# Sponsor
This committee will be in charge of sponsors for KCD Costa Rica 2025. This includes soliciting and communication with sponsors. Structuring of sponsor packages (benefits and price), guiding/educating sponsors on how best to structure and engage with the event while sponsoring. Coordinating with A/V on requirements for sponsors for their presentations, and communicate them in a timely manner.

## Role description
This role is responsible for managing the interaction with sponsors from sales through the overall execution of the event

## General Tasks
- Work with the broader team to define sponsorship opportunities for the event (what offerings are possible, pricing, execution plan, quantity, etc.)
- Manage the sales process of sponsorship opportunities from initial contact through to payment
- Manage sponsor communications to ensure eduacation / coordination
- Manage sponsor fulfillment during the event
- Sponsor experience is important, but it is lower in importance than attendee experience
- Sponsors will ask for all sorts of things - be comfortable saying 'no'
- It is OK to discourage or reject sponsors that do not fit or that might be problematic
- Value the sponsorship opportunities you are selling - if you do not, your sponsors will not
- Maintain a very short decision loop between yourself and the core organizers - you need to be able to respond to sponsors quickly (think within 12-24 hours) when they ask something off-the-wall
- Never assume a sponsor understands something or has the correct expectation - ALWAYS send it in writing and do not be afraid to repeat yourself
